If **you** are a ninja-level Javascript/Ruby coder, designer, project manager, etc. and are eager to work in Tokyo, Japan
in a dynamic environment, please get in touch at [careers@tablecheck.com](mailto:careers@tablecheck.com).

### Distributions

TableCheck Icons are distributed in the following forms:

* As raw SVGs
* As an icon font in OTF, TTF, WOFF, EOT, and SVG formats. Includes accompanying CSS and SCSS files.
* As JS module exports

### Using the Icon Font

Usage is equivalent to [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.com), except with `"tci"` CSS class as the base:

```
<i class="tci tci-ninja" />
```

You can mix Vesper Icons with Font Awesome modifiers, e.g.:

```
<i class="tci tci-butterfly fa-3x" data-fa-transform="rotate-90" />
```

### Shims

TableCheck Icons are the successor to [Vesper Icons](https://github.com/tablecheck/vesper-icons).
CSS and SCSS shims are available which bridges legacy Vesper Icons to TableCheck Icons and Font Awesome.
Note that some Vesper Icons have been retired where Font Awesome 5 provides a similar suitable replacement.

### Disclaimer

TableCheck Icons are an original creation. However, [some icons may resemble designs found elsewhere
on the internets](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ThereIsOnlyOneCloudIconInTheEntireUniverse.aspx),
including variations of icons in [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).
If we've done something daft please raise an issue and we'll discuss in a civil manner.

**To Font Awesome:** If you'd like to take icons from our set and add them to FontAwesome,
we're all for it, please get in touch.
